# Contributing to Tormented Player
I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Jei/tormentedplayer/issues)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Jei/tormentedplayer/issues); it's that easy!
Alternatively, you can send an email to [support@tormentedradio.com](mailto:support@tormentedradio.com).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## I Use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Run `flutter test` and ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I haven't set up strict checks on code style yet. In the meantime, I ask you to enable linting in your editor (it should already be enabled by default on Android Studio) and lint your code before submitting a PR.

## Keep it simple

The less changes you want to merge, the easier it will be to review them. Prefer multiple small PRs to a single monolithic PR.

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD 3-Clause license
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/Jei/tormentedplayer/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers Flutter and this project. Feel free to contact me if that's a concern.
